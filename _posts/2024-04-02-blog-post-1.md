Class imbalance refers to the situation in a classification problem where the distribution of target classes in the dataset is skewed or uneven, meaning that one class (the minority class) is significantly underrepresented compared to the other class (the majority class).

In this blog we will learn:
------

* What is class imbalance?

* Why it is important to treat class imbalance?

* How do we handle class imbalance?

  * Random undersampling
  * Tomek Links
  * Random oversampling
  * Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)
  * Adaptive synthetic sampling method (ADASYN)
  * SMOTETomek (Oversampling followed by undersampling)
  
* Summary
