My background in Mechanical Engineering (B.Tech.) has equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. Now, I'm pursuing an Executive Post-Graduation Program in Data Science at IIIT Bangalore to bridge this knowledge with the power of data analysis. I'm passionate about applying data-driven solutions to solve complex challenges and make a real impact.

I'm a lifelong learner, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skillset. I'm particularly excited about staying at the forefront of technological advancements in data science and innovation.
