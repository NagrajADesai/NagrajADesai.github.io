A Technical Enthusiast Transitioning into Data Scientist
---
Welcome to my digital corner!

With a technical background in B.Tech. degree, I’ve honed a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking skills that align perfectly with the dynamic field of Data Science. I recently completed an Executive Post-Graduation Program in Data Science with a specialization in Deep Learning from IIIT Bangalore. Currently, I’m applying this expertise as a Data Science Intern at CEAT, where I work on leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world challenges.

I am passionate about uncovering patterns, optimizing processes, and harnessing cutting-edge technologies to make impactful decisions. As a lifelong learner, I stay committed to exploring advancements in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI.
