## Building Scalable AI Systems for the Real World 🚀

### Welcome to my digital workspace

I’m Nagraj Desai, an AI Engineer based in India, focused on designing, deploying, and scaling production-grade AI systems. What began as a curiosity for problem-solving has evolved into a deep passion for building high-performance, reliable, and scalable AI solutions.

My expertise goes beyond training models—I specialize in making AI work in production.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of Large Language Models, GPU computing, and MLOps, with a strong emphasis on system efficiency and real-world deployment.

**Core strengths:**

* **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – inference optimization, RAG pipelines, and model serving
* **GPU-Accelerated Systems** – efficient GPU utilization, memory optimization, and throughput tuning
* **MLOps & Deployment** – Docker, Kubernetes-based deployments, scalable inference
* **AI Infrastructure** – vLLM, LangChain, containerized workflows, distributed systems

I focus on the *how*:

* How to serve LLMs at scale
* How to optimize latency and cost
* How to integrate AI seamlessly into user-facing applications
