## Deep Learning Projects

Eyes for the Blind: AI-Generated Captions
---------
A project aimed at empowering blind individuals to comprehend visual content by developing a generative AI model for descriptive image captions. The solution leverages an Encoder-Decoder deep learning architecture enhanced with an Attention mechanism to generate speech-based captions. The model was trained and evaluated on the Flickr8K dataset and demonstrated high performance in generating contextually accurate captions.

* Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras
* Concepts: Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Attention Mechanism, BLEU Score, Deep Learning


## Machine Learning Projects

Telecom Churn Case Study
------
A case study on top 5 factors that contribute to churn among telecom customers using service usage based analysis of high value customers. This case study makes recommendations for a telecom company to reduce churn. In addition to data cleaning and pre-processing steps, this analysis contains a highly interpretable model built using Logistic regression and 3 high performance models built on a pipeline of decomposition using Principal Component Analysis and then modelled using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. SMOTE is used to mitigate high data imbalance and Sensitivity metrics are compared for all models.

* Libraries : Pandas, StatsModels, Scikit-Learn, xgboost 
* Concepts : Data Imbalance, SMOTE, Logistic Regression, PCA, ROC-AUC, Sensitivity  



Lead Scoring for X Education
------
Helped X Education select the most promising sales leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. Built a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. Potentially improved the conversion rate from 30% to ~80%. Reported the most important attributes that indicate high chances of conversion.

* Libraries : Pandas, StatsModels, Scikit-Learn
* Concepts : Logistic Regression, Feature Elimination, ROC, AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, Recall

Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
------
Business data of a hypothetical Bike sharing company was modelled to understand the effects of different factors on the daily demand. The most important factors that influence demand were reported along with an estimate of their measure of importance. Using this data, the business could predict demand with reasonable accuracy and use the insights to strategize business goals. This is an exercise in implementing Linear Regression models for prediction and inference.

* Libraries: Scikit-learn, statsmodels, Pandas
* Concepts: Pearson's Correlation, Linear Regression, Multi collinearity, Hypothesis Testing.

Bank Credit Default Analysis
------
Loan application data of a hypothetical bank was analysed along with credit history to report customer attributes, most indicative of default. Parameters related to loan default were determined and analysed using Exploratory data analysis techniques. This analysis is useful in estimating the risk of lending and thereby make decisions like loan rejection or hike in interest rate offered.

* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Concepts: Descriptive Statistics, Imbalanced Data, Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis, Data Visualization

IMDB Movie Analysis
------
IMDB was scraped for movie data. The data was analysed for insights like the most profitable movies, the worst performing movies and top 10 movie directors. This was an exercise in importing, manipulating and grouping data to answer relevant questions.

* Programming : SQL
* Concepts : Data Cleaning, Data Sorting, Filtering, Grouping
